Modification Explanation for C4 Compiler – Exponentiation Operator Support

In this modified version of the C4 compiler, I added support for a new exponentiation operator, written as “**”. This operator allows expressions such as “2 ** 3” to be compiled and executed, yielding 8.

Key Changes:
1. Token and Opcode Definitions:
   - In the tokens enum, a new token “Exp” was added after the “Mod” token to represent the “**” operator.
   - In the opcodes enum, a new opcode “EXP” was added to denote the exponentiation operation during execution.

2. Lexical Analysis (next() function):
   - The branch handling the '*' character was modified to check if the next character is also '*'. If so, the code consumes both '*' characters and sets the token to Exp instead of Mul.

3. Expression Parsing (expr() function):
   - A new case was added in the binary operator processing loop for the Exp token.
   - This branch emits the EXP opcode and recursively calls expr(Exp) to ensure right-associativity of exponentiation.

4. Virtual Machine Execution (main() function):
   - A new case in the instruction dispatch loop handles the EXP opcode.
   - When EXP is encountered, the virtual machine pops the left operand (base) from the stack and uses the current value (exponent) to compute the result using exponentiation by squaring.

Impact on Compiler Behavior:
- With these changes, the compiler now accepts and correctly evaluates exponentiation expressions.
- The modifications preserve the minimal and self-contained design of C4, while extending its arithmetic capabilities.
- Users can now write expressions like “a = 2 ** 3;” in their C code, and the virtual machine will correctly compute the value 8.

These changes demonstrate how small modifications can extend the functionality of a minimalist compiler like C4 without compromising its overall structure.
